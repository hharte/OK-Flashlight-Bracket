# Speed-Wrap Flashlight Bracket


# Introduction

The OK Industries Speed-Wrap wire wrapping tool is useful for telecom and electronics work, where wire-wrapped connections are needed.

Over the years, the Speed-Wrap has been available in several models, most of which are still available today.

This project is a small 3D-printable bracket designed with [FreeCAD](https://freecad.org), that mounts to the rear of the tool, providing a stable mounting for a small flash light such as the [ThruNite Archer Mini](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XDTX7MX).

# Installation

Use two small zip ties to secure the flashlight to the top of the bracket.
