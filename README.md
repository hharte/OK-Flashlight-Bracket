# Speed-Wrap Flashlight Bracket


# Introduction

The OK Industries Speed-Wrap wire wrapping tool is useful for telecom and electronics work, where wire-wrapped connections are needed.

Over the years, the Speed-Wrap has been available in several models, most of which are still available today.

This project is a small 3D-printable bracket designed with [FreeCAD](https://freecad.org), that mounts to the rear of the tool, providing a stable mounting for a small flash light such as the [ThruNite Archer Mini](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XDTX7MX) or [Archer Pro v2](https://www.amazon.com/ThruNite-Flashlight-Archer-Pro-Rechargeable/dp/B0C2XSKKCT).

# Installation

Use the included STL mesh files (14mm or 18mm) to print the bracket using a 3D printer.  I suggest using PETG filament for strength.  Use an M3x20 cap head bolt and M3 nut to attach the bracket to the rear of the Speed-Wrap.

Use two small zip ties to secure the flashlight to the top of the bracket.
